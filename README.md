# TYPO3 Demo Project

This is the GIT repository for the official demo project of TYPO3. It contains
all source files to build the website for https://demo.typo3.org.

## About the Demo Project

The demo project is a fictitious informational website about apples. It acts as
an example website for people who have never worked with TYPO3, and want to play around
with the TYPO3 Administration Interface (= TYPO3 Backend).

A special demo login allows creating custom one-time editors without any password.

As soon as one backend user signs in to the TYPO3 Backend, a counter is shown both on the website
and on the TYPO3 Backend that within 30 minutes the TYPO3 installation will be re-set
to the current state.

The demo project also serves as a best practices example for using and setting up TYPO3 as a developer. You are welcome to copy the code for your own projects!

## Local Development
